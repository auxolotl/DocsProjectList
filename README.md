This repo is for tracking project statuses for anything SIG: Docs related.
## How to Use
This is a temporary place to write down any documentation goals or things to fix until we figure out something that is a bit more permanent.

Right now, create a issue with your documentation issue and tag it accordingly based on what SIG it should go to. We'll then export it using https://github.com/gavinr/github-csv-tools and figure out how to migrate to a better platform once we get there.
